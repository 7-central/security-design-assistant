# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- **Reduce schedule creation time by 90%** - Transform hours of manual drawing analysis into minutes of automated extraction for security system schedules
- **Achieve >89% accuracy on access control drawings** - Reliably extract and identify security components from technical PDF drawings
- **Generate industry-standard Excel schedules** - Produce equipment schedules matching exact column structures with proper component mapping and quantity rollups
- **Establish robust testing framework** - Implement AI-based accuracy measurement and consistency testing across multiple iterations
- **Focus on access control domain mastery** - Excel at 'A' prefixed components before expanding to CCTV or intruder systems
- **Enable internal cost savings** - Track actual hours saved on real design projects and calculate monetary value

## Background Context

The Security Design Assistant addresses a critical pain point in the security contracting industry where engineers spend up to half a day manually creating equipment schedules from technical drawings, with a 20-30% rework rate due to errors. The challenge extends beyond time investment to compound accuracy issues: accurately extracting data from complex multi-page drawings with varying standards, and applying contextual understanding to relationships between components.

Current approaches fail because generic CAD/OCR tools cannot distinguish security-specific symbols or understand system topology. This AI-powered solution employs specialized multimodal processing to parse security drawings, focusing initially on access control systems (Phase 1) to deliver immediate ROI while establishing the foundation for full security system coverage. The system is being developed as an internal tool for our own security design business, with architecture designed for future commercialization opportunities.
