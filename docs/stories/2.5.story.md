# Story 2.5: Validation Suite

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** QA engineer,  
**I want** a comprehensive test suite for accuracy measurement,  
**so that** I can ensure consistent performance.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create test set: Original B2 drawing + 5-10 variations
2. Run each through pipeline and judge evaluation
3. Compile judge assessments into overall report:
   ```
   Test Summary:
   - 8 of 10 drawings rated "Good"
   - 2 drawings rated "Fair" (complex multi-level, unusual symbols)
   - Common strengths: Door ID extraction, lock type mapping
   - Common weaknesses: Emergency exits, overlapping annotations
   - Context significantly helps with: Lock type selection, hardware associations
   ```
4. Identify drawing types that challenge the system
5. Document patterns: "System performs well on standard layouts, struggles with dense annotations"
6. Success criteria: Majority of test drawings receive "Good" assessment
7. Create recommendations for drawing types to prioritize in future development

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 2.4 Completion Notes]
- Judge Agent fully implemented with Good/Fair/Poor evaluation structure
- Judge evaluation includes 5 consistent evaluation questions
- Judge uses `gemini-2.5-pro` model for accuracy (same as all agents)
- Evaluation results saved as checkpoints with structured JSON format
- Prompt optimization framework provides good patterns for batch testing
- Test infrastructure exists with fixtures in `tests/fixtures/pdfs/`
- Storage abstraction handles both local and AWS storage seamlessly

[Source: Story 2.3 Completion Notes]
- Judge Agent evaluation schema includes all required fields for analysis
- Judge consistently addresses completeness, correctness, context usage, spatial understanding, false positives
- Judge provides improvement suggestions that can be analyzed for patterns
- Judge outputs structured JSON suitable for automated analysis

### Test Drawing Characteristics
[Source: tests/fixtures/pdfs/]
**example_b2_drawing.pdf**
- Single page security drawing
- Contains standard door/reader/exit button components  
- Clear annotations with A-prefix IDs
- Good baseline for testing fundamental extraction
- Expected assessment: "Good" (well-structured, clear symbols)

**103P3-E34-QCI-40098_Ver1.pdf**
- Multi-page complex drawing
- Mixed security and non-security pages
- Dense annotations with overlapping text
- Tests page filtering and complex spatial relationships
- Expected assessment: "Fair" (challenging but processable)

### Required Test Variations for Comprehensive Coverage
**Drawing Complexity Spectrum:**
1. **Simple** (1-2 doors): Basic functionality verification
2. **Standard** (5-15 doors): Typical project complexity
3. **Complex** (20+ doors): Scale and performance testing
4. **Mixed Systems**: Access control + other building systems
5. **Poor Quality**: Scan artifacts, low resolution
6. **Non-Standard**: Unusual symbols, ID formats, orientations

### Architecture Context

**Judge Agent Integration**
[Source: architecture/components.md#judge-agent]
- Judge Agent located at `src/agents/judge_agent_v2.py`
- Uses Gemini 2.5 Pro API for semantic evaluation
- Interface: `evaluate_extraction(drawing, components, excel)`
- Returns structured evaluation with improvement suggestions

**Storage Patterns**
[Source: architecture/components.md#storage-abstraction-layer]
- Use `StorageInterface` for all file operations
- Results storage pattern: `{job_id}/validation_results.json`
- Support both local (`./local_output/`) and AWS (S3) storage modes

**Testing Infrastructure**
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#end-to-end-tests]
- Evaluation tests located in `tests/evaluation/`
- Use real API calls for accuracy validation (not mocked)
- Test data organized in `tests/fixtures/` by category
- Results should be version-controlled for trend analysis

**Pipeline Integration**
[Source: architecture/components.md#processing-orchestrator]
- Full pipeline: context → schedule → excel_generation → judge
- Each stage saves checkpoint for artifact analysis
- Pipeline selection via `PIPELINE_CONFIGS['full_analysis']`

### Technical Implementation Details

**Batch Processing Architecture**
```python
# Validation suite workflow
for drawing in test_drawings:
    job_id = await process_drawing_full_pipeline(drawing, context)

    results.append({
        'drawing': drawing.name,
        'job_id': job_id,
        'assessment': evaluation.overall_assessment,
        'detailed_feedback': evaluation,
        'metrics': await load_performance_metrics(job_id)
    })
```

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

**Test Organization:**
- Unit tests in `tests/unit/` mirroring source structure
- Integration tests in `tests/integration/`
- Evaluation tests (real API calls) in `tests/evaluation/`

**Testing Framework:**
- pytest 8.0.0
- Mock Gemini API responses using unittest.mock for unit tests
- Real API calls for evaluation tests with `RUN_EVAL_TESTS=true`
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Test naming: `test_<component>_<action>_<expected_outcome>`

**Validation Suite Testing Strategy:**
- Unit tests: Mock all components, test logic and report generation
- Integration tests: Test validation workflow with mocked judge responses  
- Evaluation tests: Run real validation suite with small subset of drawings
- Performance tests: Measure execution time and token usage for cost optimization

**Mock Pattern for Judge Evaluation:**
```python
@patch('src.agents.judge_agent_v2.genai.Client')
def test_validation_suite_processes_drawings(mock_client):
    mock_response = Mock()
    mock_response.text = json.dumps({
        'overall_assessment': 'Good',
        'completeness': 'All components identified correctly',
        'correctness': 'Door IDs and types accurate',
        'context_usage': 'Specifications applied appropriately',
        'spatial_understanding': 'Components correctly associated',
        'false_positives': 'None detected',
        'improvement_suggestions': []
    })
    mock_client.return_value.models.generate_content.return_value = mock_response
```

**Test Data Management:**
- Store test drawings in `tests/fixtures/validation_suite/`
- Version control test results for trend analysis
- Use descriptive names for test drawings indicating their complexity/purpose
- Create metadata file describing each test case's intended challenges
