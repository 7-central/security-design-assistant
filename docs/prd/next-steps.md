# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt
*Note: Given the backend-focused nature of this system with no UI in Phase 1, UX expert involvement may be deferred until a future phase when a web interface is planned.*

## Architect Prompt
"Please review this PRD for the Security Design Assistant and create a detailed technical architecture. Focus on the serverless implementation using AWS Lambda, SQS, and DynamoDB. Pay special attention to the multi-agent AI pipeline, error handling within Lambda constraints, and the testing strategy. The system must process security drawings to extract access control components with semantic accuracy evaluation rather than numeric targets."
