## Key Documents Created/Updated

- `README.md` - Main project documentation
- `USAGE.md` - How to use the application
- `CLAUDE.md` - Development workflow
- `ARCHITECTURE_CHANGE.md` - Why we simplified
- `test_local.sh` - One-command test suite
- `docs/deployment/README.md` - Simplified deployment
- `docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md` - Updated test approach

## Notes

This story was completed as part of the architectural simplification. The documentation now accurately reflects the single-user, simplified workflow rather than the previous enterprise-style complexity.
