# Tech Stack

> âœ… **UPDATE COMPLETE**: The AI Provider has been successfully migrated from `google-cloud-aiplatform` (Vertex AI) to `google-genai` SDK in Story 0.1. See [gemini-sdk-migration-plan.md](./gemini-sdk-migration-plan.md) for migration details.

## Cloud Infrastructure

- **Provider:** AWS (Amazon Web Services)
- **Key Services:** Lambda, API Gateway, SQS, DynamoDB, S3, CloudWatch
- **Deployment Regions:** us-east-1 (primary)

| **Environment** | python-dotenv | 1.0.1 | Environment management | Simple config management for local/prod |
| **IaC** | AWS SAM | 1.100+ | Infrastructure deployment only | Defines and deploys AWS resources (Lambda, SQS, etc.) to cloud |
| **Deployment** | GitHub Actions | - | CI/CD pipeline | Free for public repos, excellent AWS integration |
| **Code Quality** | ruff | 0.1.14 | Linting and formatting | Fast, comprehensive, replaces multiple tools |
| **Type Checking** | mypy | 1.8.0 | Static type checking | Catches errors early, improves code quality |

## Development Mode Clarification

**Local Development**: Uses file system mode with environment variables to simulate AWS services locally without any AWS dependencies. FastAPI runs with `uvicorn` and stores files locally.

**Production Deployment**: SAM templates define AWS infrastructure and deploy to cloud. The same code switches behavior based on `STORAGE_MODE` environment variable.
