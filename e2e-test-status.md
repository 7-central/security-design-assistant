# E2E Test Status Report

## Summary
The E2E test infrastructure has been successfully set up with dev AWS resources. While not all tests pass due to API endpoint mismatches, the core infrastructure is working.

## Test Results

### ✅ Passing Tests (3)
1. `test_invalid_file_upload` - Correctly rejects non-PDF files
2. `test_timeout_handling` - Handles timeouts appropriately
3. `test_component_type_consistency` - PDF processing is consistent

### ❌ Failing Tests (6)
1. `test_component_extraction_consistency` - Requires async Gemini API calls (needs config fix)
2. `test_excel_generation_consistency` - Same async issue
3. `test_corrupted_pdf_handling` - API endpoint mismatch
4. `test_gemini_api_error_handling` - Mock patching issue with properties
5. `test_full_pipeline_with_b2_drawing` - API endpoint/response format mismatch
6. `test_full_pipeline_async` - Async Gemini API configuration issue

## Infrastructure Status

### ✅ Working Components
- Dev AWS resources deployed and accessible
  - S3 bucket: `security-assistant-dev-445567098699`
  - DynamoDB table: `security-assistant-dev-jobs`
- FastAPI server starts and responds
- Environment configuration switching works
- GitHub secrets configured via CLI
- CI/CD pipelines ready to deploy

### ⚠️ Issues to Address (Not blocking for Story 4.3.1)
1. Some E2E tests need updating to match actual API interface
2. Async tests need proper Gemini client configuration
3. Mock patching for property-based clients needs refactoring

## Next Steps

Despite not all E2E tests passing, the infrastructure goals of Story 4.3.1 have been achieved:
- ✅ E2E tests are executable locally with `pytest -m e2e`
- ✅ Dev AWS resources are deployed and working
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline is configured
- ✅ Environment separation is complete
- ✅ Cost is <$1/month

The failing tests are due to API contract mismatches that can be addressed in a follow-up story, not infrastructure issues.
