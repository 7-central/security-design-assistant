### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation of serverless optimization features demonstrates excellent quality and adherence to best practices. The developer has successfully implemented all required optimizations with comprehensive coverage across Lambda, S3, and cost optimization areas. The code follows clean architecture principles with proper separation of concerns, appropriate error handling, and thoughtful performance optimizations. The implementation correctly follows the architectural guidance provided in Dev Notes, particularly the use of ARM64 architecture, connection pooling patterns, and lazy loading strategies.

### Refactoring Performed

No major refactoring was required. The code is well-structured, follows Python best practices, and implements all optimizations effectively. Minor observations:

- The lazy loading implementation in `base_agent_v2.py` correctly defers Google GenAI SDK import until needed
- Connection pooling in `aws_storage.py` properly configured with increased pool size (50 connections)
- S3 batch operations utility effectively consolidates requests using async patterns
- Lambda warmer implementation correctly handles warmer requests with minimal overhead

### Compliance Check
