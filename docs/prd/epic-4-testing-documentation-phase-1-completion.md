# Epic 4: Testing, Documentation & Phase 1 Completion

**Goal**: Complete Phase 1 by establishing a solid testing foundation, creating essential documentation, and validating the system on real projects. This epic ensures the system is maintainable and ready for daily use before expanding to more drawing types.

## Story 4.1: Unit Test Foundation

**As a** developer,  
**I want** comprehensive unit tests for core functions,  
**so that** I can modify code confidently without breaking functionality.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Unit tests for utility functions:
   - PDF type detection (genuine vs scanned)
   - Job ID generation and validation
   - Component pattern matching (A-XXX-BB-B2)
   - Context type classification
   - Error message formatting
   - File path validation
2. Unit tests for data transformations:
   - Context parsing (DOCX → JSON)
   - Component extraction formatting
   - Response structure building
3. Mock external dependencies:
   - Mock Gemini API responses for agent tests (using Google GenAI SDK)
   - Mock S3 operations for file tests
4. Test execution:
   - All tests run with `pytest`
   - Tests complete in <30 seconds
   - Clear test names describing what's tested
5. Minimum 20 unit tests covering critical paths
6. Test data fixtures for common scenarios

## Story 4.2: Integration Testing & Variations

**As a** QA engineer,  
**I want** end-to-end tests with drawing variations,  
**so that** we can ensure consistent performance.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Create 10 variations of example B2 drawing:
   - Different text sizes
   - Rotated pages
   - Additional annotations
   - Removed components
   - Different symbol styles
   - Multiple pages
   - Overlapping elements
   - Poor scan quality
   - Different legends
   - Mixed system components
2. One comprehensive integration test:
   - Upload drawing → Wait for completion → Validate output
   - Verify all expected fields in response
   - Check Excel file is generated
   - Confirm no data corruption
3. Variation test suite:
   - Process all 10 variations
   - Log results for each
   - AI Judge evaluates each output
   - Document which variations challenge the system
4. Consistency validation:
   - Run base drawing 5 times
   - Verify consistent results
5. Store test results for trend analysis

## Story 4.3: Pragmatic Test Suite & E2E Validation

**As a** development team,  
**I want** a pragmatic test suite with real E2E validation,  
**so that** we can deploy v1 with confidence without over-engineering.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Fix 3 trivial unit test failures:
   - test_initialization_no_api_key in test_schedule_agent_v2.py
   - test_ensure_directories_creates_structure in test_local_storage.py
   - test_ensure_directories_permission_error in test_local_storage.py
2. Maintain 52 working unit tests as foundation (100% pass rate target)
3. Create 3-5 E2E tests with real API calls:
   - Full pipeline test: PDF upload → Context → Extract → Excel generation
   - Error handling test: Invalid PDF rejection with proper error messages
   - Consistency test: Process same drawing 3 times, verify <5% variance
4. Remove 567 complex integration/evaluation tests that cause mocking issues
5. Update test strategy documentation to reflect pragmatic approach
6. Ensure test execution meets performance targets:
   - Unit tests: <10 seconds total
   - E2E tests: <2 minutes per test

**Note:** Story 4.3 identified that E2E tests require AWS infrastructure. See Story 4.3.1 below for resolution.

## Story 4.3.1: E2E Test Infrastructure & Dev Environment Setup

**As a** developer,  
**I want** working E2E tests with dev AWS resources,  
**so that** I can validate changes locally with real API calls before deployment.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. All E2E tests executable locally with `pytest -m e2e`
2. Dev AWS resources deployed and documented
3. CI/CD pipeline runs tests on every PR
4. Clear separation of dev/prod environments
5. Total dev infrastructure cost <$5/month

**Implementation Notes:**
- Deploy minimal dev AWS resources (S3 + DynamoDB only)
- Update E2E tests to work with local FastAPI server
- Configure GitHub Actions for automated testing
- Create environment-specific .env templates

## Story 4.4: Essential Documentation

**As a** developer or operator,  
**I want** core documentation to understand and run the system,  
**so that** I can maintain and operate it effectively.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. README.md with:
   - Project overview (2-3 paragraphs)
   - Prerequisites and setup steps
   - Environment variables list
   - Quick start guide
   - Basic troubleshooting (top 5 issues)
2. API documentation:
   - Endpoint descriptions
   - Request/response examples
   - Error codes and meanings
   - Postman collection or similar
3. Deployment guide:
   - SAM deployment steps using security-assistant-sam-deployments bucket (AWS 445567098699, eu-west-2)
   - Environment configuration for staging/production
   - Rollback procedures for GitHub Actions workflows
4. Architecture overview:
   - Simple diagram (even hand-drawn)
   - Component descriptions
   - Data flow explanation
5. Prompt documentation:

   - Calculate net time saved
3. Create value report:
   - Hours saved per drawing
   - Accuracy observations
   - Types of errors encountered
   - Recommendations for Phase 2
4. Operational readiness:
   - Verify S3 bucket security-assistant-sam-deployments backups working
   - Check CloudWatch monitoring alerts fire correctly in AWS 445567098699
   - Confirm error logs are helpful in CloudWatch eu-west-2
