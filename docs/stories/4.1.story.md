## Dev Notes

### PO Validation Notes (2025-08-11)
**Story Validation Completed - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

**Clarifications for Developer:**
1. **Component Pattern Matcher Location:** The component pattern matching functionality (A-XXX-BB-B2 format) is likely implemented within the agents (check `schedule_agent_v2.py`). If not found, create a new module `src/utils/component_pattern_matcher.py` for this functionality before writing tests.

2. **Context Classifier Module:** Check if `src/utils/context_classifier.py` exists. If not, this functionality may be within `context_agent.py`. Either create the utility module or add tests directly to `test_agents/test_context_agent.py` as appropriate.

3. **Test Execution Optimization:** If test suite exceeds 30 seconds, consider using `pytest-xdist` for parallel execution (add to requirements if needed).

**All technical claims verified against architecture docs - no hallucinations detected.**

### CRITICAL NOTES FOR STORY 4.2 - INTEGRATION TESTING (2025-08-11)

**Test Suite Status After Story 4.1 Completion:**
- ✅ **Utils Tests**: 351 tests, 315 passing, 36 failing (3.12 seconds execution)
- ❌ **Full Suite**: 504 tests, 413 passing, 91 failing (76.55 seconds - exceeds 30s requirement)

**Major Issues Requiring Resolution in Story 4.2:**

1. **AWS Credential/Mocking Issues (46 errors)**
   - DynamoDB tests failing with: `UnrecognizedClientException: The security token included in the request is invalid`
   - Local storage tests failing with: `AttributeError: property 'LOCAL_OUTPUT_DIR' of 'Settings' object has no setter`
   - **Solution**: Implement proper mocking with `moto` library or `unittest.mock` for all AWS services

2. **Test Categorization Required**
   - Need to separate unit tests from integration tests using pytest markers
   - Add to `pytest.ini`:
     ```ini
     markers =
         unit: Fast unit tests with mocked dependencies
         integration: Tests requiring real AWS/external services
         slow: Tests taking >1 second
     ```

3. **Environment Configuration Issues**
   - Tests assume AWS credentials are configured (they aren't pre-deployment)
   - Settings object needs proper test fixtures
   - **Solution**: Use `@patch.dict(os.environ)` for test environment variables

4. **Failing Test Categories:**
   - `test_error_handlers.py`: Memory checking tests have recursion errors
   - `test_recommendations_engine.py`: All 18 tests failing (missing dependencies)
   - `test_validation_report_generator.py`: 7 tests failing (NoneType errors)
   - `test_success_criteria_validator.py`: 6 tests failing
   - `test_retry_logic.py`: 2 timeout-related tests failing

**Recommended Approach for Story 4.2:**
1. Fix mocking for AWS services first (will resolve ~46 errors)
2. Add proper test categorization with markers
3. Create test fixtures for Settings and environment variables
4. Run `pytest -m "unit"` for local development (should complete in <30s)
5. Run `pytest -m "integration"` only after deployment in Story 4.4

**Note**: The infrastructure code from Epic 3 exists but is NOT deployed. First deployment will occur in Story 4.4 (Production Validation).

### Previous Story Insights
Story 3.6 successfully implemented serverless optimization with comprehensive testing patterns established. Key testing achievements included:
- Comprehensive unit test coverage using pytest 8.0.0 with unittest.mock
- Proper mocking strategies for AWS services and external APIs
- Well-structured test files following the naming convention test_*.py
- Tests successfully validated optimization features including Lambda memory optimization, cold start mitigation, and S3 batch operations

### Current Testing Infrastructure [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
**Test Framework Configuration:**
- Framework: pytest 8.0.0
- Mocking: pytest-mock with unittest.mock for AI responses
- Coverage Tool: pytest-cov with 80% minimum coverage requirement
- Async Support: pytest-asyncio for async function testing
- Test Location: `tests/unit/<module_path>/` parallel to source structure

**Existing Test Coverage [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]:**
- `tests/unit/test_utils/` - Partial coverage for utilities
- `tests/unit/test_agents/` - Agent tests with Gemini mocking
- `tests/unit/test_storage/` - Storage abstraction tests
- `tests/unit/test_lambda/` - Lambda function tests
- `tests/fixtures/` - Test data and mock responses

### Utility Functions Requiring Tests [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md, file system scan]
**Core Utilities in `src/utils/`:**
1. `pdf_processor.py` - PDF type detection, page extraction (partial tests exist)
2. `validators.py` - Input validation, file path checking (partial tests exist)
3. `id_generator.py` - Job ID generation (tests exist, may need enhancement)
4. `error_handlers.py` - Error formatting, CloudWatch logging (tests exist)
5. Component pattern matching - Not yet identified in separate module, may be in agents

**Data Transformation Points:**
1. Context Agent (`src/agents/context_agent.py`) - DOCX/PDF parsing
2. Schedule Agent V2 (`src/agents/schedule_agent_v2.py`) - Component extraction
3. Excel Generation Agent (`src/agents/excel_generation_agent.py`) - Response building

### Testing Standards [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
**Unit Test Requirements:**
- Test public interfaces only - never test private methods
- Mock all external dependencies using unittest.mock
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Test naming: `test_<module>_<action>_<expected_outcome>`
- Include domain-specific edge cases (empty legends, overlapping symbols)
- Use deterministic fixtures from `tests/fixtures/`

**Critical Test Scenarios to Cover:**
1. **PDF Processing:** Genuine vs scanned detection, multipage handling, corrupted files
2. **Component Patterns:** A-XXX-BB-B2 format, variations, invalid patterns
3. **Context Classification:** DOCX tables, PDF text, unsupported formats
4. **Error Handling:** Structured logging, user messages, CloudWatch format
5. **Data Transformations:** JSON parsing, nested structures, malformed data

### File Locations [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
**Test Files to Create/Modify:**
- `tests/unit/test_utils/test_pdf_processor.py` - Enhance existing
- `tests/unit/test_utils/test_validators.py` - Enhance existing
- `tests/unit/test_utils/test_component_pattern_matcher.py` - New file
- `tests/unit/test_utils/test_context_classifier.py` - Verify/enhance existing
- `tests/unit/test_utils/test_error_handlers.py` - Enhance existing
- `tests/unit/test_agents/test_context_agent.py` - Enhance existing
- `tests/fixtures/` - Add new test data files

### Mock Patterns [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
**Gemini API Mocking Example:**
```python
@patch('src.agents.base_agent_v2.genai.Client')
def test_agent_operation(mock_client):
    mock_response = Mock()
    mock_response.text = json.dumps({'result': 'test'})
    mock_client.return_value.models.generate_content.return_value = mock_response
```

**AWS Service Mocking:**
- Use unittest.mock for S3, DynamoDB operations
- Moto library available for more complex AWS mocking
- Mock boto3 clients directly for simple operations

### Performance Requirements [Source: Epic 4 Story 4.1]
- All unit tests must complete in under 30 seconds total
- Use pytest markers to categorize slow tests if needed
- Consider using pytest-xdist for parallel execution if necessary

## Testing

**Test Framework**: pytest 8.0.0 with unittest.mock for external service mocking

**Test File Locations**:
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_utils/`, `tests/unit/test_agents/`
- Fixtures: `tests/fixtures/` with subdirectories for different file types
- Configuration: `pytest.ini` in project root

**Testing Standards**:
- Minimum 80% code coverage per module
- All tests must use mocking for external dependencies (no real API calls)
- Test names must clearly describe the scenario being tested
- Use pytest fixtures for reusable test data
- Follow AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) pattern

**Required Test Patterns**:
- Mock Gemini API responses using unittest.mock
- Use deterministic test data from fixtures directory
- Test both success and failure paths
- Include edge cases specific to security drawing domain
- Ensure all tests are isolated and can run independently
