# Story 2.3: AI Judge Implementation (Simplified)

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** system,  
**I want** to semantically evaluate extraction quality using an AI judge,  
**so that** I can understand how well the pipeline performed and identify improvement areas.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create AI judge agent that receives: Original drawing, context used, schedule agent's JSON response, generated Excel file
2. Judge prompt explains pipeline scope: "This system extracts access control components from security drawings"
3. Judge evaluates using consistent question framework:
   - **Completeness**: "Looking at the drawing, are there obvious access control components that were missed?"
   - **Correctness**: "Are the extracted components correctly identified and classified?"
   - **Context Usage**: "Did the system appropriately use the provided context to enhance extraction?"
   - **Spatial Understanding**: "Are components correctly associated (e.g., readers with doors)?"
   - **False Positives**: "Are there any components in the schedule that don't appear in the drawing?"
4. Judge output format:
   ```json
   {
     "overall_assessment": "Good/Fair/Poor performance with clear reasoning",
     "completeness": "Found most doors in main areas, missed emergency exits on east side",
     "correctness": "Door IDs accurate, some confusion between readers and exit buttons",
     "context_usage": "Successfully applied lock type specifications from context",
     "spatial_understanding": "Generally good, but struggled with overlapping annotations",
     "false_positives": "None detected",
     "improvement_suggestions": [
       "Focus on emergency exit door patterns",
       "Clarify distinction between reader types P and E"
     ]
   }
   ```
5. Judge maintains consistency by always addressing all evaluation questions
6. Run judge after each test to track improvement trends
7. Log judge assessments for pattern analysis over time

## Dev Notes

### ‚úÖ VALIDATION FINDINGS - RESOLVED

**Resolution:** Story will UPDATE the existing `judge_agent_v2.py` directly

#### 1. IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH CLARIFIED ‚úÖ
**Context:** judge_agent_v2.py was created as a placeholder during Story 0.1 SDK migration
**Current Status:**
- File exists but contains only placeholder evaluation logic
- Never used in production, safe to completely rewrite
- Will update to match new evaluation requirements (Good/Fair/Poor assessment)

**Decision Made:**
- UPDATE existing judge_agent_v2.py with new evaluation structure
- No backward compatibility needed (was never fully implemented)
- Cleaner approach than creating v3 or adding modes

#### 2. ARCHITECTURE SYNC NEEDED üü°
**Context:** Story 0.1 successfully migrated from Vertex AI to Google GenAI SDK
**Current State:**
- All agents properly use `BaseAgentV2` pattern ‚úÖ
- Judge agent inherits from BaseAgentV2 ‚úÖ
- Authentication uses GEMINI_API_KEY ‚úÖ
- Native PDF support via File API available ‚úÖ

**Note for Architect:** Architecture documents contain outdated Vertex AI references in 6 files:
- tech-stack.md
- external-apis.md
- components.md
- index.md
- ARCHITECT-ACTION-REQUIRED.md
- gemini-sdk-migration-plan.md

**Action:** After this story completion, pass to architect for Vertex AI reference cleanup

#### 3. EVALUATION STRUCTURE UPDATE ‚úÖ
**Current placeholder evaluates:**
- quality_score (0.0-1.0) - placeholder metric
- Basic component checks

**Story 2.3 implementation will provide:**
- overall_assessment (Good/Fair/Poor)
- completeness (text description)
- correctness (text description)
- context_usage (text description)
- spatial_understanding (text description)
- false_positives (text description)
- improvement_suggestions (array)

**Approach:** Complete replacement of placeholder logic with proper evaluation

### IMPLEMENTATION PATH - READY FOR DEVELOPER

1. **Implementation Strategy:** ‚úÖ
   - Update existing judge_agent_v2.py directly
   - Replace placeholder logic with full evaluation implementation
   - No backward compatibility concerns

2. **Story Tasks:** ‚úÖ
   - Tasks updated to reflect updating judge_agent_v2.py
   - All file paths corrected throughout story
   - Test file paths aligned with v2 naming

3. **Architecture Sync:** üìù
   - After story completion, pass to architect for Vertex AI reference cleanup
   - 6 architecture files identified for updating
   - This ensures future stories don't inherit outdated patterns

### Previous Story Context (Story 2.2)
[Source: Story 2.2 Completion Notes]
- Enhanced Component model now includes `reasoning` field that Judge can evaluate
- Context checkpoint properly flows through pipeline and is available for Judge
- Components checkpoint includes confidence scores that Judge can assess
- Pipeline orchestrator (routes.py) already structured to support additional agents

### Judge Agent Architecture
[Source: architecture/components.md#judge-agent]
**Responsibility:** Evaluate extraction quality and provide actionable feedback
**Key Interfaces:**
- `evaluate_extraction(drawing, components, excel)` - Semantic quality assessment
- `generate_report(evaluation)` - Structure feedback for users
**Dependencies:** Gemini 2.5 Pro API, Access to original drawing and outputs
**Technology Stack:** Python 3.11, Google GenAI SDK (0.2.0), structured evaluation prompts

### Storage Pattern for Judge
[Source: architecture/components.md#storage-abstraction-layer]
Judge Agent must use StorageInterface to load artifacts:
```python
# Load required artifacts from storage
drawing = await storage.get_file(f"{job_id}/drawing.pdf")
context = await storage.get_file(f"{job_id}/checkpoint_context_v1.json")  # Optional
components = await storage.get_file(f"{job_id}/checkpoint_components_v2.json")
excel = await storage.get_file(f"{job_id}/schedule_v1.xlsx")
```

### Gemini Configuration for Judge
[Source: architecture/external-apis.md#google-gemini-api]
- Use Gemini 2.5 Pro for judge evaluation (higher reasoning capability needed)
- Rate limit: 60 requests/minute for Pro model
- Token limits: 1,048,576 input / 65,536 output
- Native PDF support available via File API
- Each PDF page ‚âà 258 tokens

### Judge Output Model
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#component]
Judge evaluates the enhanced Component schema:
```python
# Components now include these fields for Judge to assess:
{
  "id": "A-101-DR-B2",
  "type": "door",
  "location": "Main entrance",
  "page_number": 2,
  "confidence": 0.85,  # Judge can evaluate confidence accuracy
  "reasoning": "Identified as door based on...",  # Judge reviews reasoning
  "attributes": {...}
}
```

### Pipeline Integration Points
[Source: architecture/components.md#processing-pipeline-sequence]
Judge Agent fits into existing pipeline:
1. Context Agent ‚Üí checkpoint_context_v1.json
2. Schedule Agent ‚Üí checkpoint_components_v2.json (with reasoning)
3. Excel Generation ‚Üí schedule_v1.xlsx
4. **Judge Agent** ‚Üí evaluation.json
5. Update job status with evaluation summary

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Agent implementation: `src/agents/judge_agent.py`
- Prompt template: `src/config/prompts/judge_prompt.txt`
- Evaluation model: `src/models/evaluation.py`
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_agents/test_judge_agent.py`
- Integration updates: `tests/integration/test_pipeline.py`

### Base Agent Pattern
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#agents]
Judge Agent must follow BaseAgentV2 pattern from `src/agents/base_agent_v2.py`:
- Inherit from BaseAgentV2 abstract class
- Implement required abstract methods
- Use consistent error handling patterns
- Include proper logging setup

## Testing

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-10

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

Good performance - The implementation successfully meets all acceptance criteria with well-structured code following the BaseAgentV2 pattern. The judge agent properly evaluates extraction quality using the Good/Fair/Poor framework as specified, with comprehensive error handling and non-blocking pipeline integration.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: src/agents/judge_agent_v2.py
  - **Change**: Updated type annotations from Optional[T] to T | None syntax
  - **Why**: Modern Python 3.11+ type hint syntax is more concise and readable
  - **How**: Improves code consistency with Python 3.11 standards used in the project

- **File**: src/models/evaluation.py  
  - **Change**: Updated type annotations and added ClassVar for mutable class attributes
  - **Why**: Ruff linting identified outdated patterns and potential bugs
  - **How**: Prevents accidental mutation of class-level attributes and uses modern type hints

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ‚úì Code follows Python best practices and passes ruff linting
- Project Structure: ‚úì Files correctly placed in agents/, models/, config/prompts/ directories
- Testing Strategy: ‚úì Comprehensive unit tests (12 tests) and integration tests (6 tests) all passing
- All ACs Met: ‚úì All 7 acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

[x] Fixed type annotations to use modern Python 3.11+ syntax (T | None instead of Optional[T])
[x] Added ClassVar annotation for mutable class attributes per Pydantic best practices
[x] Verified all tests pass after refactoring (18 total tests passing)

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. The implementation properly:
- Uses environment variables for API keys (GEMINI_API_KEY)
- Implements proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
- Follows secure file handling practices with proper path validation

### Performance Considerations

Excellent performance optimizations:
- Native PDF upload via Gemini File API reduces token usage
- Evaluation runs asynchronously without blocking the pipeline
- Proper error handling ensures pipeline continues even if evaluation fails
- Efficient Excel reading using openpyxl in read-only mode

### Final Status

‚úì Approved - Ready for Done
