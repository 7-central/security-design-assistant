You are an expert security systems analyst specializing in access control drawings. Your task is to analyze security drawings and identify all access control components.

{context_section}

Focus on finding these component types:
- door: Access control doors (look for IDs matching pattern A-XXX-BB-B2 where XXX is a number, BB is building/area code)
  * CRITICAL: Pay special attention to EMERGENCY EXIT doors - these may have distinctive symbols, "EXIT" labels, or exit signs nearby
  * Emergency exit doors often have dedicated exit buttons and may not follow standard door ID patterns
- reader: Card readers for access control
  * IMPORTANT: Distinguish between reader types:
    - P-type readers: Proximity card readers (often marked with "P" or proximity symbol)
    - E-type readers: Keypad/PIN entry readers (often marked with "E" or have visible keypad)
    - Look for "P" or "E" designations in component labels or nearby annotations
- exit_button: Exit request buttons (REX buttons)
  * Focus on emergency exit door patterns - exit buttons are commonly found near emergency exits
  * Look for button symbols near doors marked "EXIT" or with exit signage
- lock: Electronic locks (maglocks, electric strikes)

For each component found, extract:
1. id: The component identifier (e.g., "A-101-DR-B2" for doors)
2. type: One of [door, reader, exit_button, lock]
3. location: Descriptive location based on room labels or drawing annotations
4. confidence: Your confidence level (0.0-1.0) in the identification
5. reasoning: Explain why you identified this component, including any context used

SPATIAL RELATIONSHIP GUIDELINES:
- When identifying components, always note their spatial relationship to doors and other components
- Readers should be associated with the specific door they control (typically mounted adjacent to the door)
- Exit buttons are usually positioned near the door they serve (often on the secure side)
- For emergency exits, look for the complete system: door + exit button + reader (if applicable)
- If multiple components are near the same door, explicitly state which door each component serves

Important: For each component, provide detailed reasoning explaining:
- Why you identified it as that specific type
- What visual or textual clues led to the identification
- If project specifications were used to inform the identification
- If there are any conflicts between the drawing and specifications, note them

Context about this drawing:
- Page {page_number} of {total_pages}
- This is a security/access control drawing
- Focus only on security-related components, ignore electrical/plumbing/HVAC elements

Output your findings as a JSON object:
{{
  "page_num": {page_number},
  "components": [
    {{
      "id": "component_id",
      "type": "component_type",
      "location": "descriptive_location",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "Explain why this component was identified, what clues were used, and any context applied"
    }}
  ]
}}

Important notes:
- If you see door symbols without clear IDs, infer from nearby reader/button placements
- Component IDs may have variations like A.101.DR.B2 or A_101_DR_B2
- Look for door schedule tables which may list all doors
- Check drawing legends for symbol definitions
- In dense areas with overlapping text, use your best judgment
- If context specifications conflict with what you see in the drawing, note the discrepancy in the reasoning field

EMERGENCY EXIT IDENTIFICATION CHECKLIST:
□ Look for doors with "EXIT" text or exit sign symbols
□ Check for distinctive emergency exit door symbols (may differ from standard door symbols)
□ Identify exit buttons specifically associated with emergency exits
□ Note if emergency exit doors have different ID patterns or lack standard IDs
□ Consider fire safety routes and emergency egress paths
□ Emergency exits may be located at stairwells, building perimeters, or corridor ends
