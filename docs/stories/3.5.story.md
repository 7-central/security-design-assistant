# Story 3.5: Serverless Deployment

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** infrastructure as code and automated deployments,  
**so that** we can reliably deploy the serverless architecture.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. AWS SAM template defining all resources:
   - Lambda functions with environment configs
   - SQS queues with DLQ
   - DynamoDB table with indexes
   - API Gateway with stages
   - IAM roles with least privilege
2. GitHub Actions workflow:
   - On PR: sam validate and cfn-lint
   - On merge to develop: Deploy to staging
   - On merge to main: Deploy to production
3. Environment configurations:
   - Dev: Lower Lambda memory, shorter timeouts
   - Staging: Production-like with test data
   - Prod: Full resources, monitoring enabled
4. SAM deployment features:
   - Gradual deployment with CloudWatch alarms
   - Automatic rollback on errors
   - Parameter store for sensitive configs
5. Lambda layers for dependencies:
   - Common libraries in shared layer
   - Reduces deployment package size
   - Version controlled
6. Pre-traffic and post-traffic hooks for validation
7. Deployment notifications via SNS/Slack
8. Real deployment integration:
   - Staging deployment successful with real AWS credentials
   - Production deployment validated with approval gates
   - All placeholders replaced with actual account details
   - Branch protection rules active on actual repository
   - Deployment documentation updated with real-world lessons
