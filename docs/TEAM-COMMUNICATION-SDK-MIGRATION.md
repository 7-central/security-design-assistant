# üì¢ URGENT: Team Communication - Sprint Emergency Update

**To**: All Team Members  
**From**: Bob (Scrum Master)  
**Date**: 2025-08-06  
**Subject**: CRITICAL - Development Freeze & SDK Migration

## üõë IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### Development Freeze Effective Immediately

All team members must **STOP** current development work. We have identified a critical architectural issue that blocks production deployment.

## What Happened?

During QA review of Story 1.3, we discovered we're using Google's **deprecated Vertex AI SDK** instead of their new **GenAI SDK**. This is a blocking issue that affects our entire AI pipeline.

## Impact

- ‚ùå **Cannot deploy to production** with deprecated SDK
- üí∞ **Missing 50-75% cost savings** available with new SDK  
- üèóÔ∏è **Architecture mismatch** with Google's current best practices
- üìö **Documentation disconnect** - all Google docs reference new SDK

## New Priority: Story 0.1

**Story 0.1: Google GenAI SDK Migration** is now our **ONLY** priority.
- **Points**: 40 (full team effort)
- **Duration**: 1 week
- **Status**: Starting immediately

## Your Action Items

### All Developers
1. **Stop** current work immediately
2. **Review** Story 0.1 in `/docs/stories/0.1.story.md`
3. **Read** migration plan in `/docs/architecture/gemini-sdk-migration-plan.md`
4. **Attend** emergency planning meeting (see below)

### DevOps
1. **Prepare** for new environment variable: `GEMINI_API_KEY`
2. **Remove** old vars: `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`, `VERTEX_AI_PROJECT_ID`, `VERTEX_AI_LOCATION`
3. **Update** deployment scripts

### QA Team
1. **Prepare** comprehensive regression test plan
2. **Plan** for re-recording all VCR cassettes
3. **Identify** critical test scenarios for validation

## Daily Schedule This Week

**Daily Standups**: 9:00 AM Sharp
- Focus: Story 0.1 progress only
- Format: What I did, what I'm doing, blockers

**End of Day Check-ins**: 4:30 PM
- Quick sync on progress
- Identify overnight needs

## Why This Is Actually Good News

1. **Cost Savings**: 50-75% reduction in AI processing costs
2. **Better Performance**: Native PDF support (no conversion needed)
3. **Simpler Code**: 40% less boilerplate
4. **Future Proof**: Aligned with Google's roadmap

## Timeline Impact

- Original Phase 1: 6 weeks
- Revised Phase 1: 7 weeks
- **Net Impact**: 1 week delay for significant improvements

## Key Resources

- **Sprint Backlog**: `/docs/SPRINT-BACKLOG-EMERGENCY-UPDATE.md`
- **Story Details**: `/docs/stories/0.1.story.md`
- **Migration Plan**: `/docs/architecture/gemini-sdk-migration-plan.md`
- **Architecture Update**: `/docs/architecture/ARCHITECT-ACTION-REQUIRED.md`

## Emergency Planning Meeting

**When**: Today, 2:00 PM  
**Duration**: 30 minutes  
**Agenda**:
1. Migration overview (5 min)
2. Task breakdown and assignments (15 min)
3. Success criteria review (5 min)
4. Q&A (5 min)

## Remember

This is a **quality gate** we must pass. While it's frustrating to pause forward progress, this migration will:
- Save significant costs
- Improve performance
- Simplify our codebase
- Prevent future breaking changes

Let's tackle this as a team and come out stronger!

## Questions?

Contact me (Bob) on Slack or email. I'm available all day for questions or concerns.

Let's turn this challenge into an opportunity! üí™
