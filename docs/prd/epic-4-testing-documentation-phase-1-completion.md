# Epic 4: Testing, Documentation & Phase 1 Completion

**Goal**: Complete Phase 1 by establishing a solid testing foundation, creating essential documentation, and validating the system on real projects. This epic ensures the system is maintainable and ready for daily use before expanding to more drawing types.

## Story 4.1: Unit Test Foundation

**As a** developer,  
**I want** comprehensive unit tests for core functions,  
**so that** I can modify code confidently without breaking functionality.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Unit tests for utility functions:
   - PDF type detection (genuine vs scanned)
   - Job ID generation and validation
   - Component pattern matching (A-XXX-BB-B2)
   - Context type classification
   - Error message formatting
   - File path validation
2. Unit tests for data transformations:
   - Context parsing (DOCX → JSON)
   - Component extraction formatting
   - Response structure building
3. Mock external dependencies:
   - Mock Vertex AI responses for agent tests
   - Mock S3 operations for file tests
4. Test execution:
   - All tests run with `pytest`
   - Tests complete in <30 seconds
   - Clear test names describing what's tested
5. Minimum 20 unit tests covering critical paths
6. Test data fixtures for common scenarios

## Story 4.2: Integration Testing & Variations

**As a** QA engineer,  
**I want** end-to-end tests with drawing variations,  
**so that** we can ensure consistent performance.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Create 10 variations of example B2 drawing:
   - Different text sizes
   - Rotated pages
   - Additional annotations
   - Removed components
   - Different symbol styles
   - Multiple pages
   - Overlapping elements
   - Poor scan quality
   - Different legends
   - Mixed system components
2. One comprehensive integration test:
   - Upload drawing → Wait for completion → Validate output
   - Verify all expected fields in response
   - Check Excel file is generated
   - Confirm no data corruption
3. Variation test suite:
   - Process all 10 variations
   - Log results for each
   - AI Judge evaluates each output
   - Document which variations challenge the system
4. Consistency validation:
   - Run base drawing 5 times
   - Verify consistent results
5. Store test results for trend analysis

## Story 4.3: Essential Documentation

**As a** developer or operator,  
**I want** core documentation to understand and run the system,  
**so that** I can maintain and operate it effectively.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. README.md with:
   - Project overview (2-3 paragraphs)
   - Prerequisites and setup steps
   - Environment variables list
   - Quick start guide
   - Basic troubleshooting (top 5 issues)
2. API documentation:
   - Endpoint descriptions
   - Request/response examples
   - Error codes and meanings
   - Postman collection or similar
3. Deployment guide:
   - SAM deployment steps
   - Environment configuration
   - Rollback procedures
4. Architecture overview:
   - Simple diagram (even hand-drawn)
   - Component descriptions
   - Data flow explanation
5. Prompt documentation:
   - Current prompt versions
   - What each agent does
   - How to modify prompts
6. Testing guide:
   - How to run tests
   - How to add new test drawings
   - How to interpret AI Judge results

## Story 4.4: Production Validation

**As a** business owner,  
**I want** to validate the system on real projects,  
**so that** we can measure actual value delivered.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Process 3-5 real project drawings:
   - Different projects/buildings
   - Document time taken
   - Note any issues encountered
   - Get AI Judge assessment
2. Time tracking comparison:
   - Manual process time (baseline)
   - Automated process time
   - Correction time for errors
   - Calculate net time saved
3. Create value report:
   - Hours saved per drawing
   - Accuracy observations
   - Types of errors encountered
   - Recommendations for Phase 2
4. Operational readiness:
   - Verify backups working
   - Check monitoring alerts fire correctly
   - Confirm error logs are helpful
   - Test recovery from Lambda timeout
5. Knowledge capture:
   - Document lessons learned
   - List drawing characteristics that work well
   - Note patterns that challenge the system
6. Go/no-go decision criteria for Phase 2

## Story 4.5: Phase 1 Cleanup & Handoff

**As a** product owner,  
**I want** Phase 1 properly closed with clear next steps,  
**so that** Phase 2 can begin smoothly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Technical debt documentation:
   - List shortcuts taken
   - Known limitations
   - Recommended improvements
2. Phase 2 preparation:
   - Collect 5-10 diverse access drawings
   - Create test plan for generalization
   - Document hypothesis for improvement
3. Codebase cleanup:
   - Remove debug code
   - Delete unused files
   - Update dependencies
   - Fix any security warnings
4. Final metrics:
   - Total development time
   - Actual vs estimated accuracy
   - Infrastructure costs
   - Token usage patterns
5. Handoff package:
   - All documentation reviewed
   - Test suite passing
   - Production system stable
   - Clear Phase 2 roadmap
6. Team retrospective:
   - What worked well
   - What to improve
   - Lessons for Phase 2
