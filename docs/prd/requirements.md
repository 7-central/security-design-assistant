# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

- **FR1:** The system shall process security drawings in PDF format initially, with architecture designed to support native AutoCAD (.dwg) and Visio (.vsd/.vsdx) formats in future phases
- **FR2:** The system shall identify and extract text identifiers following security system patterns (e.g., A-XXX-BB-B2 for access control)
- **FR3:** The system shall intelligently recognize security-specific symbols in context, adapting to variations in symbol representation through contextual understanding rather than rigid pattern matching
- **FR4:** The system shall parse drawing legends and use contextual clues to understand project-specific symbol meanings
- **FR5:** The system shall associate hardware types with doors including Lock Types as identified in project specifications
- **FR6:** The system shall generate Excel-compatible schedules with industry-standard column structure for door equipment and lock types
- **FR7:** The system shall calculate and provide quantity rollups for each equipment type automatically
- **FR8:** The system shall process drawings to completion regardless of time, prioritizing accuracy over speed
- **FR9:** The system shall support context injection through specification documents, with capability for interactive clarification when context is ambiguous
- **FR10:** The system shall implement an AI judge to analyze parser output and provide confidence scoring for each extracted component
- **FR11:** The system shall provide detailed error reporting showing what was extracted, confidence levels, and areas requiring manual review
- **FR12:** The system shall handle partial drawing readability by clearly identifying processed vs unprocessed sections
- **FR13:** The system shall support iterative refinement where users can correct AI interpretations to improve future processing
- **FR14:** The system shall provide explanations for its interpretations, showing why it made specific decisions

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR1:** The system shall achieve sufficient accuracy to provide net time savings compared to manual processing, measured by total time including error correction
- **NFR2:** The system shall maintain consistent results across multiple runs of the same drawing
- **NFR3:** The system shall implement data privacy measures appropriate for the AI service provider's data handling policies
- **NFR4:** The system shall use sandboxed execution environments for code generation agents
- **NFR5:** The system shall not retain drawing data after processing is complete
- **NFR6:** The system shall maintain a complete audit trail of agent decisions and processing steps
- **NFR7:** The system shall implement AI provider utilities as modular components for easy model switching
- **NFR8:** The system shall implement modular multi-agent architecture with clear agent boundaries
- **NFR9:** The system shall support version tracking to enable comparison between drawing revisions (future enhancement)
- **NFR10:** The system shall optimize for accuracy first, with performance optimizations as secondary concern
- **NFR11:** The system shall measure and report actual time savings per project to validate business value
