# Story 2.1: Context Processing Framework

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** system,  
**I want** to process context from multiple sources (DOCX, PDF, text),  
**so that** I can use project-specific information to improve drawing interpretation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Update `/process-drawing` endpoint to accept optional context parameter (file or text)
2. Context classifier identifies type: `{type: "docx"|"pdf"|"text", format: "file"|"string"}`
3. DOCX processing: Extract text using python-docx, preserve section headings and tables
4. PDF context: Use Gemini Flash multimodal to extract structured content
5. Text context: Parse directly into structured format
6. All context converted to schema: `{sections: [{title: str, content: str, type: "specification"|"general"}]}`
7. Context agent uses Gemini Flash for cost-efficient processing
8. Error handling: Gracefully continue without context if processing fails
9. Log context processing: `{type: str, sections_found: N, tokens_used: N}`

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.5 (End-to-End Testing) implementation:
- Pipeline is fully working with PDF processing and Excel generation
- Processing time is 80-120 seconds for full pipeline
- API response structure is established with job_id and status tracking
- Error handling patterns are established for file processing
- Storage patterns are working for multi-file operations

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md#/process-drawing]
The `/process-drawing` endpoint currently accepts:
- `drawing_file`: PDF file (required)
- `client_name`: string (required) 
- `project_name`: string (required)
- `pipeline`: enum [full_analysis, no_context, extract_only] (optional)

New parameters to add:
- `context_file`: Optional file upload (DOCX/PDF/TXT)
- `context_text`: Optional text string as alternative to file

Response schema remains the same: `JobCreatedResponse` with job_id and status.

### Context Agent Implementation
[Source: architecture/components.md#context-agent]
**Responsibility**: Process optional context documents into AI-friendly structured format

**Key Interfaces**:
- `extract_context(file_path) -> dict` - Process DOCX/PDF/text into structured JSON
- `summarize_specifications(raw_text) -> dict` - Extract lock types and requirements

**Dependencies**: 
- Gemini 2.5 Flash API for cost-efficient processing
- Document parsers: python-docx, pypdf
- Storage abstraction for saving context checkpoints

**Technology Stack**: Python 3.11, Google GenAI SDK (0.2.0), cost-optimized for Flash model

### Context Data Schema
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#checkpoint]
Context data should be saved as checkpoint in S3:
```json
{
  "sections": [
    {
      "title": "Lock Types and Hardware", 
      "content": "Type 11: Electromagnetic lock...",
      "type": "specification"
    },
    {
      "title": "General Requirements",
      "content": "All doors must comply with...", 
      "type": "general"
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "source_type": "docx|pdf|text",
    "sections_count": 2,
    "tokens_used": 1500,
    "processing_time_ms": 3200
  }
}
```

### File Storage Structure
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md#s3-bucket-structure]
Context files and checkpoints stored at:
```
./output/job_<id>/
├── drawing.pdf          # Original PDF
├── context.docx         # Optional context file
├── checkpoint_context_v1.json   # Context extraction results
├── checkpoint_components_v1.json # Components from drawing
├── schedule_v1.xlsx     # Generated Excel
└── evaluation.json      # Quality evaluation
```

### Gemini API Integration
[Source: architecture/external-apis.md#google-gemini-api]
- Use Gemini 2.5 Flash for context processing ($0.075/1M input tokens)
- Native PDF support available - no manual conversion needed
- API Key authentication via GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable
- Rate limits: 1000 requests/minute for Flash model
- File API for persistent uploads with 48-hour retention

### Pipeline Integration
[Source: architecture/components.md#processing-pipeline-sequence]
Context Agent fits in pipeline as:
1. API uploads drawing + optional context file
2. **Context Agent processes context file (NEW)**
3. Schedule Agent uses context + drawing for component extraction
4. Excel Generation Agent creates schedule
5. Judge Agent evaluates results

### Storage Abstraction Usage
[Source: architecture/components.md#storage-abstraction-layer]
Use `StorageInterface` for all file operations:
- `save_file(path, content)` for context checkpoints
- `get_file(path)` for loading context data
- Automatically handles local vs AWS storage based on STORAGE_MODE

### Error Handling Patterns
[Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#business-logic-errors]
- Log context processing errors but continue pipeline
- Use try/catch blocks around context processing
- Set reasonable timeout limits (30 seconds max)
- Return empty context structure if processing fails
- Include error details in job metadata for debugging

### Cost Optimization
[Source: architecture/external-apis.md#integration-notes]
- Use Gemini 2.5 Flash (not Pro) for context processing
- Context caching available for repeated documents (75% savings)
- Batch processing potential for multiple context docs
- Track token usage and costs in job metadata

## Testing

### Test Framework Configuration
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]
- **Framework**: pytest 8.0.0
- **Test Location**: `tests/unit/test_agents/test_context_agent.py`
- **Mocking**: pytest-mock with VCR.py for Gemini API responses
- **Coverage Requirement**: 80% minimum per module

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#context-agent-test-cases]

**Unit Test Cases**:
1. Parse simple DOCX with lock specifications - Extract lock types 11-22 from tables
2. Handle multi-section specifications - Correctly identify relevant vs irrelevant sections  
3. Process scanned PDF context - Use Gemini Flash for OCR and extraction
4. Empty context document - Gracefully handle files with no relevant content
5. Malformed document - Error handling for corrupted files
6. Large context file - Performance with 100+ page specifications

**Test File Structure**:
- Use AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock all external dependencies
- Use VCR.py cassettes for Gemini API responses
- Place test fixtures in `tests/fixtures/context/`

**Integration Test Coverage**:
- Full pipeline with context file processing
- Pipeline continuation when context fails
- API endpoint with various context formats
- Cost tracking and logging verification

### Test Execution
```bash
pytest tests/unit/test_agents/test_context_agent.py -v
pytest tests/integration/test_context_pipeline.py -v
```

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-10

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation successfully meets all acceptance criteria with clean, well-structured code. The Context Agent properly extends BaseAgentV2, implements graceful error handling, and follows the project's async patterns. The code demonstrates good separation of concerns with distinct methods for each file type processing. Type hints and structured logging are properly implemented throughout.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: src/agents/context_agent.py
  - **Change**: Fixed model name from "models/gemini-2.0-flash-exp" to "models/gemini-2.5-flash"
  - **Why**: The Dev Notes specifically require Gemini 2.5 Flash for cost efficiency, not 2.0 flash-exp
  - **How**: Ensures correct model usage as specified in requirements for optimal cost/performance balance

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ All naming conventions followed (snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for classes)
- Project Structure: ✓ Files correctly placed in src/agents/, tests organized properly
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit tests with mocking, follows AAA pattern
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 9 acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested

### Improvements Checklist

[x] Fixed incorrect Gemini model name (context_agent.py:19)
[ ] Consider extracting hardcoded prompt strings to configuration/constants for maintainability
[ ] Add performance metrics collection for different file sizes to optimize timeout settings
[ ] Consider implementing caching for repeated context documents as mentioned in Dev Notes

### Security Review

No security issues found. The implementation properly:
- Validates file types before processing
- Uses temporary files with proper cleanup
- Includes timeout limits (30 seconds) to prevent resource exhaustion
- Sanitizes file content before processing
- No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data

### Performance Considerations

- Token limit awareness implemented (10k char limit in summarization prompt)
- Efficient file type detection using multiple strategies (MIME type, extension, content signature)
- Async processing for all AI calls as required
- Graceful degradation ensures pipeline continues even if context processing fails

### Final Status

✓ Approved - Ready for Done

The implementation is solid and production-ready. All acceptance criteria are met, tests are comprehensive and passing, and the code follows all project standards. The minor model name fix has been applied. The suggested improvements are nice-to-haves that can be addressed in future iterations.
