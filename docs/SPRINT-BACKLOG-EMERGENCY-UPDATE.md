### Current Sprint Backlog (REVISED PRIORITY)

| Priority | Story | Status | Points | Assignee | Notes |
|----------|-------|--------|--------|----------|-------|
| **üî¥ P0** | **0.1 - Google GenAI SDK Migration** | **In Progress** | **40** | **All Team** | **BLOCKING - Must complete first** |

### Epic Progress Update

**Epic 1: Minimal Working Pipeline**
- Original: 2 weeks
- Actual: 3 weeks (added 1 week for SDK migration)
- Progress: 42/82 points (with 0.1 included)

### Daily Focus for Story 0.1

**Day 1-2**: Infrastructure & Configuration
- Update dependencies
- New environment configuration
- Update settings modules

**Day 3-4**: Agent Migration
- Migrate all 4 agents to new SDK
- Implement native PDF support

**Day 5**: Testing Updates
- Re-record VCR cassettes
- Update all test mocks

**Day 6**: Documentation & Validation
- Update all docs
- Performance testing
- Cost validation

**Day 7**: Buffer & Deployment Prep
- Final testing
- Rollback preparation
- Production readiness check

### Team Communication

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. **All Developers**: Stop current work, pull latest, review Story 0.1
2. **DevOps**: Prepare for new GEMINI_API_KEY configuration
3. **QA**: Prepare comprehensive regression test plan
4. **Tech Lead**: Review migration plan and assign subtasks

**Daily Standups**: 
- Focus exclusively on Story 0.1 progress
- Identify blockers immediately
- Share migration learnings

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Technical Risks**:
   - Keep .legacy backup files
   - Feature flag for gradual rollout
   - Side-by-side testing

2. **Schedule Risks**:
   - Daily progress tracking
   - Early escalation of blockers
   - Consider pair programming for complex parts

### Success Metrics

Story 0.1 is complete when:
- [ ] Zero references to old SDK remain
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Cost reduction verified (min 25%)
- [ ] Performance equal or better
- [ ] Documentation fully updated

### Sprint Retrospective Topics

Once Story 0.1 is complete, we'll discuss:
1. How did we miss the SDK deprecation?
2. What checks can prevent similar issues?
3. Should we have a regular "tech debt review"?
4. Lessons learned from emergency pivots

**Next Sprint Planning**: Will resume normal sprint planning after Story 0.1 completion. All previously planned stories remain valid but shifted by 1 week.
