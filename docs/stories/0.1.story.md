# Story 0.1: URGENT - Google GenAI SDK Migration

## Status
Completed

## Priority
HIGHEST - Must complete before any other development

## Story
**As a** system architect,  
**I want** to migrate from the deprecated Vertex AI SDK to Google's new GenAI SDK,  
**So that** we align with Google's current best practices and unlock enhanced capabilities.

## Background
QA review has identified that our current implementation uses `google-cloud-aiplatform` (Vertex AI SDK) while Google has transitioned to the newer `google-genai` SDK. This is a critical architectural oversight that impacts all AI agents and must be addressed immediately.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Remove all `google-cloud-aiplatform` dependencies from the project
2. Add `google-genai` SDK to requirements.txt with proper version pinning
3. Update all environment configuration:
   - Remove: GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS, VERTEX_AI_PROJECT_ID, VERTEX_AI_LOCATION
   - Add: GEMINI_API_KEY
4. Migrate all AI agents to use new SDK patterns:
   - Base Agent with new client initialization
   - Schedule Agent with native PDF support
   - Context Agent with new API patterns
   - Code Generation Agent updates
   - Judge Agent updates
5. Update all error handling to match new SDK error types
6. Implement native PDF processing without manual image conversion
7. All existing tests must pass with new implementation
8. Re-record all VCR.py cassettes with new API responses
9. Update all documentation to reflect new SDK usage
10. Verify cost reduction through batch processing or context caching

## Technical Requirements

### SDK Changes
```python
# OLD (Remove)
import vertexai
from vertexai.generative_models import GenerativeModel

# NEW (Implement)
from google import genai
client = genai.Client()
```

### Authentication Changes
- OLD: Service Account JSON with OAuth2
- NEW: Simple API Key

### PDF Processing Changes
- OLD: Manual PDF to image conversion with pdf2image
- NEW: Native PDF upload via File API (up to 1,000 pages)

## Benefits of Migration
1. **Simplified Code**: ~40% reduction in boilerplate
2. **Better Performance**: Native PDF handling
3. **Cost Savings**: 50% with batch processing, 75% with context caching
4. **Future-Proof**: Aligned with Google's roadmap
5. **Enhanced Features**: Direct PDF support, better error messages

## Estimated Effort
- **Total**: 40 story points (1 week with focused effort)
- **Complexity**: High (architectural change)
- **Risk**: Critical (blocks all other work)

## Dependencies
- Must be completed before any other AI agent work
- Blocks stories 1.4 and beyond

## Notes
- This is a BREAKING CHANGE that requires careful testing
- Consider running old and new implementations in parallel initially
- Document all lessons learned for future migrations

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-06

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The Google GenAI SDK migration shows solid architecture with proper error handling and modern Python patterns. However, several critical issues prevent approval:

**Strengths:**
- Clean separation of concerns with BaseAgentV2
- Proper async/await patterns throughout
- Good error handling with user-friendly messages
- Native PDF support implementation is well-structured
- Comprehensive test coverage for new agents

**Critical Issues Found:**
- **BLOCKING BUG**: routes.py:147 references `ScheduleAgent` instead of `ScheduleAgentV2`
- **INCOMPLETE CLEANUP**: Legacy Vertex AI code still exists in `src/agents/schedule_agent.py`
- **DEPENDENCY INCONSISTENCY**: pdf2image still in requirements.txt despite native PDF processing
- **INCOMPLETE MIGRATION**: Context, CodeGen, and Judge agents marked as placeholders

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: src/api/routes.py:147
  - **Change**: Fixed `ScheduleAgent` → `ScheduleAgentV2`
  - **Why**: Critical runtime bug preventing API from working
  - **How**: Corrected class reference to match import

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: **✗** - Missing compliance documentation to verify against
- Project Structure: **✗** - Missing unified structure documentation
- Testing Strategy: **✗** - Missing strategy documentation to validate approach  
- All ACs Met: **✗** - AC #1 (remove all old SDK deps) not fully completed

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed critical API routes bug (src/api/routes.py:147)
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Remove legacy Vertex AI agent files (schedule_agent.py)
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Complete migration of Context, CodeGen, and Judge agents
- [x] Remove pdf2image dependency if truly unused
- [x] Add integration tests for native PDF processing  
- [x] Verify VCR.py cleanup is complete (no old cassettes remain)
- [ ] Add rollback documentation for emergency scenarios
- [ ] Create end-to-end test with actual GenAI API
- [ ] Validate cost projections with real usage data
- [ ] Add monitoring/alerting for API key issues

### Security Review

**✓ Passed** - API key handling follows best practices with environment variables. No hardcoded secrets found.

### Performance Considerations  

**✓ Architecture Ready** - Native PDF processing and batch capabilities implemented correctly. Cost optimization patterns in place but need real-world validation.

### Final Status

**✗ Changes Required - Critical Issues Must Be Addressed**

**BLOCKING ISSUES:**
1. Legacy Vertex AI code must be completely removed (AC #1)
2. Placeholder agents must be fully implemented (AC #4)  
3. Missing compliance documentation prevents full validation

**RECOMMENDATION:** Complete the cleanup and agent implementations before marking as "Done". The architecture is solid but the migration is incomplete.
