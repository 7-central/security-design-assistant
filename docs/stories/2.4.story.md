# Story 2.4: Prompt Optimization Sprint

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** to iteratively improve prompts based on judge feedback,  
**so that** I can reach the target accuracy.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create prompt versioning system
2. After each judge evaluation, identify top 2 improvement suggestions
3. Implement prompt changes addressing judge feedback
4. Test iterations: Run drawing → Get judge feedback → Adjust → Repeat
5. Track progression: "v1: Fair (missed exits) → v2: Good (found exits, confused readers) → v3: Good (all issues addressed)"
6. Success criteria: 3 consecutive "Good" assessments with minor issues only
7. Document what prompt changes led to improvements

## Dev Notes

### Prompt Optimization Workflow
The optimization process should follow this iterative cycle:
1. **Baseline Assessment**: Run v1 prompt against all test drawings, get judge evaluations
2. **Analysis**: Identify common failure patterns across evaluations
3. **Targeted Improvement**: Modify prompt to address top 2 issues
4. **Validation**: Test new version against same drawings
5. **Iterate**: Repeat until achieving 3 consecutive "Good" assessments

**Version Control Strategy:**
- Each prompt version is immutable once created
- New versions build on previous, with changes clearly documented
- Failed experiments should still be saved (e.g., v4_experimental) for learning
- The `schedule_prompt.txt` file always points to current production version

**Expected Iteration Timeline:**
- Version 1: Baseline (current production prompt)
- Version 2-4: Major improvements (addressing critical gaps)
- Version 5-6: Fine-tuning (minor adjustments)
- Target: Achieve success criteria by version 6 or less

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 2.3 Completion Notes]
- Judge Agent successfully implemented with Good/Fair/Poor evaluation structure
- Judge evaluation integrated into pipeline (non-blocking)
- Judge prompt includes 5 consistent evaluation questions
- Evaluation results saved as checkpoint for analysis
- Judge Agent must use `gemini-2.5-pro` model (same as all other agents)
- Model configuration should come from settings.GEMINI_MODEL

### Test Drawing Characteristics
[Source: tests/fixtures/pdfs/]
**example_b2_drawing.pdf**
- Single page security drawing
- Contains standard door/reader/exit button components
- Clear annotations with A-prefix IDs
- Good baseline for testing fundamental extraction

**103P3-E34-QCI-40098_Ver1.pdf**
- Multi-page complex drawing
- Mixed security and non-security pages
- Dense annotations with overlapping text
- Tests page filtering and complex spatial relationships

**Additional Test Cases to Consider:**
- Emergency exit patterns (often missed in v1)
- Reader type distinctions (P vs E types)
- Doors without explicit labels
- Components with non-standard ID formats

### Current Prompt Locations
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#config]
- Schedule prompt: `src/config/prompts/schedule_prompt.txt`
- Judge prompt: `src/config/prompts/judge_prompt.txt`
- Context prompt: `src/config/prompts/context_prompt.txt`

### Agent Architecture
[Source: architecture/components.md#schedule-agent]
**Schedule Agent:**
- Main extraction logic in `extract_components(drawing_path, context=None)`
- Uses Gemini 2.5 Pro for drawing analysis
- Native PDF support via File API
- Located at `src/agents/schedule_agent_v2.py`

[Source: architecture/components.md#judge-agent]
**Judge Agent:**
- Evaluation method: `evaluate_extraction(drawing, components, excel)`
- Uses Gemini Flash for cost efficiency
- Returns structured evaluation with improvement suggestions
- Located at `src/agents/judge_agent_v2.py`

### Storage Patterns
[Source: architecture/components.md#storage-abstraction-layer]
- Use `StorageInterface` for all file operations
- Local development uses `LocalStorage` implementation
- Save results to appropriate checkpoints:
  ```python
  await storage.save_file(f"{job_id}/prompt_v{n}_evaluation.json", evaluation_data)
  ```

## PO Validation Findings - RESOLVED

### 1. Judge Agent Model Version - CRITICAL FIX REQUIRED
**Issue:** Multiple agents using invalid/incorrect Gemini models
**Resolution:** Added prerequisite task to standardize ALL agents to `gemini-2.5-pro`
**Dev Note:** The `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` model is INVALID and must not be used

### 2. Test Fixture Availability - CONFIRMED ✅
**Verified:** Both test PDFs exist in `tests/fixtures/pdfs/`:
- `example_b2_drawing.pdf` - EXISTS
- `103P3-E34-QCI-40098_Ver1.pdf` - EXISTS
**Action:** No changes needed, fixtures are available

### 3. Prompt Configuration Module - CORRECTED ✅  
**Issue:** File name inconsistency
**Resolution:** Module should be `prompt_version_manager.py` (not prompt_config.py)
**Action:** Fixed in File Structure section below

### Configuration Management
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]
- All settings via environment variables
- Use `src/config/settings.py` for configuration management
- Never hardcode values in prompts or code

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

**Test Organization:**
- Unit tests in `tests/unit/` mirroring source structure
- Integration tests in `tests/integration/`
- Evaluation tests (real API calls) in `tests/evaluation/`

**Testing Framework:**
- pytest 8.0.0
- Mock Gemini API responses using unittest.mock
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Test naming: `test_<component>_<action>_<expected_outcome>`

**Mock Pattern for Judge Agent:**
```python
@patch('src.agents.judge_agent_v2.genai.Client')
def test_feedback_analyzer_extracts_improvements(mock_client):
    mock_response = Mock()
    mock_response.text = json.dumps({
        'overall_assessment': 'Fair',
        'improvement_suggestions': [
            'Focus on emergency exit door patterns',
            'Clarify distinction between reader types P and E'
        ]
    })
    mock_client.return_value.models.generate_content.return_value = mock_response
```

**Evaluation Testing:**
- Real API calls for prompt optimization validation
- Run with `RUN_EVAL_TESTS=true pytest tests/evaluation/`
- Save results to `tests/evaluation/prompt_optimization_results/`
