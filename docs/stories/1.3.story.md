## Dev Notes

### CRITICAL: SDK Migration Context
**This story has been updated following the completion of Story 0.1 (Google GenAI SDK Migration)**
- The original implementation used the deprecated Vertex AI SDK
- All AI agents now use the new Google GenAI SDK (`google-genai`)
- Authentication simplified from service accounts to API keys
- Native PDF processing now available without manual conversion

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2 implementation:
- PDF processor successfully handles both genuine and scanned PDFs
- PDF data structure: `{pages: [{page_num: 1, content: ...}]}` where content is either text or PIL Image
- Job model already has metadata and processing_results fields for storing component data
- Error handling pattern established with specific HTTP status codes
- Batch processing implemented for memory efficiency with large PDFs

### Available Test Resources
- **Example Security Drawing:** `103P3-E34-QCI-40098_Ver1.pdf` available in `.ignore/` directory
- **Test Fixtures Location:** Copy to `tests/fixtures/pdfs/` for development use
- **Note:** This is a real security drawing with A-XXX-BB-B2 patterns - use for main development
- **Other Test Cases:** Create synthetic PDFs for edge cases as needed

### AI Integration Stack - UPDATED FOR GENAI SDK
[Updated following Story 0.1]
- **Provider:** Google GenAI (not Vertex AI)
- **SDK:** `google-genai` (not `google-cloud-aiplatform`)
- **Models:** Gemini 2.5 Pro for accuracy, Gemini 2.5 Flash for cost optimization
- **Pricing:** With optimizations: 50% savings via batch, 75% via context caching
- **Authentication:** Simple API key via `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable
- **Configuration:** Only `GEMINI_API_KEY` required (no PROJECT_ID or LOCATION)

### Agent Architecture - V2 Pattern
[Updated following Story 0.1]
All agents now inherit from `base_agent_v2.py` which provides:
- GenAI SDK client initialization
- Built-in retry logic (no manual retry configuration needed)
- Native PDF file handling via File API
- Async processing with proper error handling
- Structured logging and cost tracking
- Context caching support for cost optimization

### Schedule Agent V2 Implementation
The Schedule Agent has already been migrated in Story 0.1:
- Location: `src/agents/schedule_agent_v2.py`
- Inherits from: `BaseAgentV2`
- Key features:
  - Native PDF upload for files > 20MB via File API
  - Automatic page handling up to 1,000 pages
  - No manual PDF-to-image conversion
  - Built-in retry and error handling

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#component]
Component schema remains unchanged:
```python
{
    "id": str,              # e.g., "A-101-DR-B2"
    "type": str,            # "door", "reader", "exit_button", "lock"
    "location": str,        # Descriptive location
    "page_number": int,     # Source page in PDF
    "confidence": float,    # 0.0-1.0
    "attributes": dict      # Flexible project-specific properties
}
```

### File Locations - V2 Structure
Based on Story 0.1 implementation:
- Schedule agent V2: `src/agents/schedule_agent_v2.py` (already exists)
- Base agent V2: `src/agents/base_agent_v2.py` (already exists)
- Prompt template: `src/config/prompts/schedule_prompt.txt` (existing)
- API routes: `src/api/routes.py` (already updated to use V2)
- Test file: `tests/unit/test_agents/test_schedule_agent_v2.py` (already exists)
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_pdf_native_processing.py` (new)

### GenAI SDK Configuration
[Updated from Story 0.1]
```python
# Simple initialization
from google import genai

class BaseAgentV2:
    def _initialize_client(self):
        self.client = genai.Client(
            api_key=self.settings.gemini_api_key
        )
```

### Enhanced PDF Processing
With the new SDK:
1. **Native PDF Support**: Direct upload without conversion
2. **File API**: For PDFs > 20MB
3. **Automatic Handling**: Up to 1,000 pages
4. **Cost Optimization**: Use context caching for repeated analysis

### Error Handling - Simplified
The new SDK provides:
- Built-in retry logic (no manual configuration)
- Clearer error messages
- Simplified error types
- Automatic exponential backoff

### Cost Optimization Strategies
1. **Context Caching** (75% cost reduction):
   - Cache common security standards or templates
   - Reuse for multiple drawings
2. **Batch Processing** (50% cost reduction):
   - Process multiple pages together
   - Use for non-urgent processing

### Technical Constraints
[Updated for GenAI SDK]
- Model: Gemini 2.5 Pro for accuracy, Flash for speed
- Token limits handled automatically by SDK
- Native support for up to 1,000 PDF pages
- Maximum processing time: 10 minutes (Lambda timeout)

### Testing - Updated for GenAI SDK

**Testing Standards** [Updated following Story 0.1]
- Test Framework: pytest 8.0.0
- Test file location: `tests/unit/test_agents/test_schedule_agent_v2.py`
- Coverage requirement: 80% minimum for schedule_agent_v2 module
- Use AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock GenAI client calls (VCR.py not needed with new SDK)
- Focus on integration tests for native PDF processing

**Critical Test Scenarios** [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#schedule-agent-test-cases]:
1. Standard single-page drawing - Extract all A-prefix components correctly
2. Multi-page mixed systems - Filter security pages from electrical/plumbing
3. Dense overlapping annotations - Handle text overlap near door symbols
4. Non-standard component IDs - Recognize variations like A.101.DR.B2
5. Missing door labels - Infer door locations from reader/button placement
6. Poor scan quality - Low resolution or grainy images
7. Empty drawing legend - Work without symbol definitions
8. Duplicate component IDs - Handle naming conflicts
9. **NEW**: Native PDF upload via File API
10. **NEW**: Context caching for repeated analysis
11. **NEW**: Batch processing for multiple pages

## Architect Notes - Story Update Required

### Context
This story was originally implemented using the deprecated Vertex AI SDK. Following the QA review and completion of Story 0.1 (Google GenAI SDK Migration), this story needs to be reimplemented using the new SDK patterns.

### Key Changes for Developer:
1. **Use Existing V2 Implementation**: The Schedule Agent has already been migrated to `schedule_agent_v2.py` in Story 0.1
2. **No New Development Needed**: The core functionality is already implemented
3. **Integration Work**: Ensure the V2 agent is properly integrated and tested
4. **Remove Legacy Code**: Clean up any remaining Vertex AI references

### What's Already Done:
- ✅ ScheduleAgentV2 fully implemented with GenAI SDK
- ✅ Native PDF processing via File API
- ✅ BaseAgentV2 provides all necessary infrastructure
- ✅ API routes already updated to use V2 agent
- ✅ Unit and integration tests created

### What Remains:
- Verify the V2 implementation meets all original acceptance criteria
- Run comprehensive tests with the example security drawing
- Update any documentation that still references Vertex AI
- Ensure cost optimization features are properly utilized

### Technical Guidance:
The developer should focus on validation and testing rather than reimplementation. The heavy lifting was done in Story 0.1. This story now becomes about ensuring the new implementation fully satisfies the business requirements.
