# Next Steps

## Immediate Actions (Before Development)

1. **Address Checklist Recommendations**
   - Document git workflow and branch strategy
   - Run dependency license audit
   - Consider Gemini API fallback approach (can be deferred if timeline is tight)

2. **Prepare Test Fixtures**
   - Collect or create 8-10 test documents as specified in Test Strategy section
   - Include your example B2 drawing and variations
   - Create simple DOCX specifications with lock type tables

3. **Set Up Development Environment**
   - Create repository with monorepo structure
   - Initialize Python 3.11 environment
   - Set up .env.example with required variables
   - Configure AWS credentials for team

## Development Phase

1. **Epic 1: Minimal Working Pipeline** (2 weeks)
   - Start with Story 1.1: Project setup and basic API
   - Focus on end-to-end flow before optimization
   - Use local file system mode for rapid development

2. **Epic 2: Accuracy & Context Enhancement** (2 weeks)
   - Implement context processing
   - Iteratively improve prompts based on judge feedback
   - Run evaluation tests on test fixtures

3. **Epic 3: Production Infrastructure** (1 week)
   - Deploy serverless infrastructure
   - Set up monitoring and alerts
   - Test error recovery scenarios

4. **Epic 4: Testing & Documentation** (1 week)
   - Complete test suite with VCR.py recordings
   - Validate on real project drawings
   - Document lessons learned

## Key Implementation Guidance

**For AI Developers:**
- Follow the coding standards strictly, especially storage abstraction
- Implement comprehensive error handling from the start
- Write tests for each component using the specified scenarios
- Check token counts before all Gemini API calls

**For Human Developers:**
- Review AI-generated code for the specific rules in coding standards
- Ensure checkpoint saves occur after each agent
- Verify proper async patterns for AI calls
- Monitor for interface stability violations

## Success Metrics

Track these metrics during Phase 1:
- Processing time per drawing (target: <10 minutes)
- Accuracy based on judge evaluation (target: "Good" rating)
- System reliability (target: <5% failure rate)
- Token usage per drawing (for cost tracking)
- Time saved vs manual process (target: 90% reduction)

## Post-Phase 1 Roadmap

Once Phase 1 is successfully deployed and validated:

1. **Expand Component Coverage**
   - Add CCTV components (C-prefix)
   - Add intruder detection (I-prefix)
   - Handle more complex drawing types

2. **Enhanced Features**
   - Web dashboard for pipeline selection
   - Drawing revision comparison
   - Batch processing capabilities
   - Webhook notifications

3. **Commercialization Prep**
   - Multi-tenant authentication
   - Usage-based billing integration
   - Enhanced security audit trails
   - SLA monitoring and reporting

## Architecture Handoff

This architecture document is now ready for development. Key handoff points:

- **For Dev Lead:** Review tech stack, set up repository structure
- **For AI Agents:** Use this as primary reference, follow all coding standards
- **For QA:** Test scenarios and coverage requirements are defined
- **For DevOps:** Infrastructure templates and deployment pipeline ready

The architecture achieves a HIGH readiness rating with clear implementation path and excellent AI-development suitability. Begin with Epic 1 Story 1.1 and iterate from there.
